Be aware that there is a little round magnet (5mm diameter, 1..2mm height) needed at the rear side of the top part. Glue the magnet with a drop of cyanoacrylate with the correct polarity (as in the original).

The phone holder fits very tightly with an S23FE inserted into the center console, it is not recommended to insert bigger phones than that.
